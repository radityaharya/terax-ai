# Terminal symbols

`terax-terminal-symbols.woff2` contains all 10,071 mapped private-use characters
from Ghostty's `JetBrainsMonoNerdFont-Regular.ttf`, including Powerline, Devicons,
Seti, Codicons, Font Awesome, and Material Design icons. Text and color emoji
continue using the selected text font and platform fallback. The subset keeps
the original cell metrics and outlines, removes hinting, and renames the family
to Terax Terminal Symbols.

Run `scripts/build-terminal-symbols.py` with the path to that exact source font.
The script validates its hash, preserves the source timestamp, validates the
complete private-use character map after rebuilding, and enforces the byte limit.
The source is also available in the Zig package cache after building the core.

The SIL Open Font License and Nerd Fonts notices accompany the source here and
ship in `public/licenses/terminal-symbols.txt`. Original copyright metadata is
retained in the font. One font face serves regular, bold, and italic fallback;
the webview synthesizes styles. It is loaded once before terminal rasterization
so an atlas cannot cache a missing-font glyph while the face is still loading.
